# HUB: Discounts on Cross-Chain Transfers

When moving tokens between Minter and Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, the user pays the bridge fee (1% on the amount transacted) on top of the network fee. For example, the fee for sending 100 USDT from Binance Smart Chain to Minter stands at 1 USDT.

If the user holds the HUB token on their balance, however, they are charged a reduced bridge fee.

## In Figures

- 1 HUB: -10%
- 2 HUB: -20%
- 4 HUB: -30%
- 8 HUB: -40%
- 16 HUB: -50%
- 32 HUB: -60%

For example, if you have 16 HUB on your balance, then when transferring USDT from the Minter network to Ethereum, the fee you pay will be not 1% but 50% less—that is, 0.5%.

## How to Activate

For the discount to be enabled, the balance of the address that a cross-chain transfer is made from needs to have the necessary amount of HUB on either of the interconnected networks. Example: one may hold 32 HUB on their Minter address’ balance and enjoy the discount when depositing from a similar address on Ethereum *(the only difference between the Ethereum and Minter addresses being that the former starts with **0x**, and the latter, with **Mx**).* The coins that are locked into the pools will count as well.

HUB can be bought via [liquidity pools](https://explorer.minter.network/coins/HUB) on Minter by making a simple swap in [Minter Console](https://console.minter.network/swap) or in [BIP Wallet](https://www.bip.to/). You can also purchase it on [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/USDT/0x8e9A29e7Ed21DB7c5B2E1cd75e676dA0236dfB45) (Ethereum) or [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c&outputCurrency=0x8ac0a467f878f3561d309cf9b0994b0530b0a9d2) (Binance Smart Chain).
