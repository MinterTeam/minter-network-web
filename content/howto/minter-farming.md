# Whatâ€™s farming?
Farming is a special program to reward liquidity providers with extra incentives, in addition to regular swap fees they already get (*0.2% per each*).

Anyone can join. For that, you need to [add liquidity](https://www.minter.network/howto/pools#how-to-add-liquidity) into one (or all) of the pools listed below.
You can also [transfer Ethereum assets](https://teletype.in/@biplenta/usdt-bip-en) you already have and get their mirrored versions on Minter in return (refer to the **USDT Deposit** section, the algorithm is the same for all supported ERC-20 tokens).

## Active farming programs
Ongoing programs offered by MDF can be found at [Minter Explorer](https://explorer.minter.network/farming).

Other farming initiatives, including those launched by regular users, are available at [Chainik](https://chainik.io/yf).

* Snapshots of providers are taken on a daily basis at a random time
* The size of reward is calculated based on the volume of liquidity you've provided
* Rewards are sent out in multi-send transactions on a daily basis at a random time
