# What’s farming?
Farming is a special program to reward liquidity providers with extra incentives, in addition to regular swap fees they already get (*0.2% per each*).

Anyone can join. For that, you need to [add liquidity](https://www.minter.network/howto/pools#how-to-add-liquidity) into one (or all) of the pools listed below.
You can also [transfer Ethereum assets](https://teletype.in/@biplenta/usdt-bip-en) you already have and get their mirrored versions on Minter in return (refer to the **USDT Deposit** section, the algorithm is the same for all supported ERC-20 tokens).
