title: What Is HUB Token Needed For?

# Practical Application of HUB

HUB is a token staked by [Minter Hub](/earn/minter-hub) oracles. Its main features are:

- Validation of the Minter Hub network (up to 1% on all cross-chain transfers)
- Voting on DAO-related issues
- Reduction of fees charged for making cross-chain transfers
- [Provision of liquidity to the pools](/earn/earn-liquidity-pools) (0.2â€“0.3% on the amount swapped)

By staking HUB, validators receive up to 1% of cross-chain transfers made by users as a fee. The transaction cost can go to as low as 0.4%, provided the sender holds HUB tokens on their balance. Users may also earn on [delegating HUB](/earn/hub-staking) to oracles and receiving a share of fees charged for cross-chain transfers.
