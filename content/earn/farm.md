# What's Yield Farming?

**Yield farming**, or simply **farming**, means that on top of a share of [fee](/earn/lp-fees) charged for every trade (0.2%), [LPs](/earn/liquidity-providers) get an additional reward for the very fact of locking their assets into the pool. Farming is one of the major money-making strategies in DeFi.

So, how to yield farm? Anyone can do that by following these 3 simple steps:

1. Choose a farming program from the [list](https://explorer.minter.network/farming)
2. Top up your wallet for the necessary amount of tokens. You can do that via [Minter Console](https://console.minter.network/swap) or [BIP Wallet](https://www.bip.to/). If you have no coins on the Minter network yet, you can [deposit them from Ethereum](/earn/cross-chain#how-to-transfer-tokens-from-ethereum-to-minter-deposit) using a [bridge in Minter Console](https://console.minter.network/hub) ([what is Minter Hub?](/earn/minter-hub))
3. Use [Minter Console](https://console.minter.network/pool) to [add liquidity](https://www.minter.network/howto/pools#how-to-add-liquidity) into the pool that participates in the farming program you've picked

From now on, you'll be getting rewards to your wallet according to the terms of a selected farming program.

*Alert! Before adding liquidity into the pool, make sure you fully understand the risks associated with [Impermanent Loss](/earn/impermanent-loss).*
