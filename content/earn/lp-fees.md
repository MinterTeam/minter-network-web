# Liquidity Provider's Fee Rewards

Each time a transaction is made in a liquidity pool, a trader is charged a fee of 0.2% on the swap volume (token sold). Since either token of the pool can be sold, the fee can also be charged in either token. This 0.2-percent fee goes straight into the pool, making it bigger and richer.

That way, the fee earned by the pool is distributed among all [liquidity providers](/earn/liquidity-providers). To collect rewards from fees, the liquidity provider has to [remove liquidity from the pool](https://www.minter.network/howto/pools#how-to-remove-liquidity).

You may use explorer services to view APY *(yearly returns)* by the pool:
