# What's a Liquidity Pool?

A liquidity pool is a trading pair of coins/tokens with locked-up funds of [liquidity providers](/earn/liquidity-providers) that guarantee swappability. Buying or selling a coin through a liquidity pool, a trader uses funds that have been locked into the pool. Unlike centralized exchanges with limit orders and order books, liquidity pools don't require you to place an order and wait for it to be filled. The [trading](/earn/trading) process is carried out using Automated Market Maker (AMM).

AMM controls the proportion of coins and regulates the price depending on direction (*buy or sell*). [Learn more](https://teletype.in/@biplenta/minter-pools-en)

The pool's liquidity is secured by [LPs](/earn/liquidity-providers).
