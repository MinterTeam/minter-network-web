# What's BIPx?

For [BIP](/earn/bip) to be used in the world's best decentralized finance (DeFi) services beyond Minter, it will be issued on other blockchains under the BIPx ticker. It has already gone live on [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcafe34bae6f1b23a6b575303edcc0578d2188131) July 1st, 2021, and is expected to arrive at Binance Smart Chain (BSC) September 1st, 2021.

When you withdraw BIP to another network, it is locked on Minter and released on a given network as BIPx. The reverse operation is similar: BIPx is burned on the external network and is unlocked on Minter as BIP. The exchange rate is always 1:1.

In short, BIPx is BIP mirrored onto the outer chains. To learn more, read [this article](https://minterteam.medium.com/17905b034285).
