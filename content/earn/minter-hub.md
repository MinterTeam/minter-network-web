# What's Minter Hub?

**Minter Hub** is a bridge interconnecting different blockchains that's responsible for cross-chain transfers, lock control, and token mint and burn. Minter Hub is Minter's sidechain, whose first release connects Minter with Ethereum.

Executing user commands, Minter Hub acts as a custodian and operator of tokens across chains mentioned above. For example, using the bridge, one may send the USDT token from the Ethereum network to Minter and vice versa.

This way, Minter makes it possible to hold, transfer, and swap the majority of popular digital assetsâ€”ETH, stablecoins (USDT, USDC, and more), wrapped BTC, DeFi coins, and others.
